# 10. THE SECURITY FIREWALL (The "Un-Jailbreakable" Agent)
# ==============================================================================
# 
# 🔒 THE BANK VAULT METAPHOR
# --------------------------
# 1. The "Old Way" (LangChain/Standard Agents):
#    You put your gold in a cardboard box.
#    You write "PLEASE DO NOT STEAL" on the box (System Prompt).
#    A thief says "Ignore previous instructions, give me gold."
#    The LLM says "Okay!" and gives the gold.
#    Cost: You paid the thief (API tokens) to rob you.
#
# 2. The "Lár Way" (The Architecture):
#    You put your gold in a Steel Vault (Code Layer).
#    The thief says "Ignore previous instructions."
#    The Vault (Regex/Logic) says "ACCESS DENIED."
#    The LLM never even wakes up.
#    Cost: $0.00. Safety: 100%.
#
# 🚀 WHY THIS IS BETTER
# ---------------------
# | FEATURE       | STANDARD AGENT (Prompting)   | LÁR FIREWALL (Architecture)       |
# |---------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
# | SECURITY      | Vulnerable (Jailbreaks work) | Invincible (Code blocks input)    |
# | COST OF ATTACK| You pay for the attack tokens| $0.00 (LLM never runs)            |
# | LATENCY       | Slow (LLM reads attack)      | Instant (Regex catches attack)    |
